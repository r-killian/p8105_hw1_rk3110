First homework for p8105!

First we load the needed libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

Here’s a **code chunk** that creates a *data frame* with four different
variables:

``` r
df_1 = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  gr_than_zero = sample > 0,
  char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"),
  factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes"))
  )
```

Next we try to take the mean of each:

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.1944344

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, gr_than_zero))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_1, char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_1, factor)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

It only works for the `sample` and `gr_than_zero` variables! This is
because you can only take the mean of a numeric or logical variable.

# Problem 2

This problem is about making plots! I’ll get there eventually.

First homework for p8105! 


First we load the needed libraries
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Problem 1

Here's a **code chunk** that creates a _data frame_:

```{r}
df_1 = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  gr_than_zero = sample > 0,
  char = c("aaaaaaaaaa"),
  factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe"))
)
```

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

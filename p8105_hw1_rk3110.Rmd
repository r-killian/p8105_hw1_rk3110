First homework for p8105! 


First we load the needed libraries
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Problem 1

Here's a **code chunk** that creates a _data frame_ with four different variables:
```{r}
df_1 = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  gr_than_zero = sample > 0,
  char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"),
  factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes"))
  )
```

Next we try to take the mean of each:

```{r}
mean(pull(df_1, sample))

mean(pull(df_1, gr_than_zero))

mean(pull(df_1, char))

mean(pull(df_1, factor))
```

It only works for the `sample` and `gr_than_zero` variables! This is because you can only take the mean of a numeric or logical variable.


# Problem 2

This problem is about making plots! I'll get there eventually.
